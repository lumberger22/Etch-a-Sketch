# Etch-a-Sketch

This is my Etch-a-Sketch, interactice project. Through this project I intend to allow the user to draw in a window with the look of an Etch-a-Sketch toy on their own screen.

The Etch-a-Sketch project will be composed of the toy outline with a screen to draw on, a button to choose the grid size of the window, and a button to clear the screen of all drawings. To complete this I am using strictly HTML, CSS, and Javascript: HTML for the visual structure appearing on the webpage, CSS to style the HTML elements, and Javascript for the functionality of the page.

Challenges I faced: While this project was not a long one, it did require me to learn alot about how to refresh the page and different types of event listeners, like the 'mouseenter' which I used here.

I hope to include this page into a larger site with several games and activities for the user to use.
